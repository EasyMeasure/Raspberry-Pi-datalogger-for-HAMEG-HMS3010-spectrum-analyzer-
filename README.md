# Raspberry-Pi-datalogger-for-HAMEG-HMS3010-spectrum-analyzer
Small unoptimized but working python tool to automate frequency sweeps and datalogging with a HAMEG HMS3010 spectrum analyzer with tracking generator at a user defined time interval. The code snippet was written based on the HAMEG_EN_COMMAND_SCPI_HMS.pdf manual by HAMEG Instruments GmbH. See also the comments in the .py file.
The code snippet in this repo was used to log the behavior of a sensor developed by EasyMeasure B.V., www.easymeasure.nl through frequency sweeps at user defined time intervals.
